Write test cases in spring boot poc project
<br>
httpclient is used but we use mockito - mocking framework and mockmvc - class provide bean and controller for test casses and PowerMock is a framework that extends other mock libraries such as EasyMock with more powerful capabilities. 
<br>
The primary usage of PowerMock has been the ability to mock static, final and/or private methods. Mockito2 now supports the mocking of final classes/methods. If you use Mockito2, it is recommended to use Mockito for mocking final methods/classes.
